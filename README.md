> What really interested me about them was that they can sometimes tell what the future holds.

#### Youtube
These are the 2 channels that I mainly watch since they deal with analyzing the backstory of video games and if some theories are correct
* [Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w)
* [SuperHorrorBro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChL4WU9YLlxXXNSwlzM1-7g)
>There is also other channels that I like to watch. It is mostly gaming channels in youtube. But that is because it is really entertaining when others play videogames especially if there is any jumpscares that scares the youtubers.
